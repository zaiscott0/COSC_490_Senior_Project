# COSC_490_Senior_Project
My group's senior project at morgan state university


The Real_Property_Information dataset
can be a valuable resource for real estate
professionals, policymakers, and
researchers interested in the Baltimore
City area's housing market. By leveraging
the information provided by this dataset
and applying advanced analytical
techniques, we can gain a better
understanding of the real estate market
and make informed decisions.

MODEL METHOD : Decision Tree

ACCURACY : 82%

======================== TASKS ==============================


Dataset:  Real Property Information | Real Property Information | Open Baltimore (baltimorecity.gov)

Deliverable: Show your graph.

Download a data file

Use the DataFrame API to visualize your data in Jupyter Notebook at Welcome To Colaboratory - Colaboratory (google.com). 

Show measures of central tendency (You may want to consider converting categorical/nominal values into numerical values)

Show diagrams, histograms (nominal values)

Show box plots for each numerical features or for selected features

Identify any outliers

Plot the correlation between each pair of numerical features

Clean Dataset

Develop Python Code to do machine learning on your data set.

Step 1- Pick one feature of your choosing (i.e., column name to be your target)

Step 2 - Develop code that trains, tests and tunes a model to make accurate predictions on the target. Research examples to develop and test your own classifier.

Develop a ML model that will predict that column.

Show a model and the accuracy of the model
